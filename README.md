Bot to automate the fill in of a form
The script is in Spanish. Ask for translation.

It has a menu with a few options:
  1) Insert the URL
  2) Check status of the web
  3) Show the params of the form you want to fill in
  4)Create users (referred to users, it could be anything)
  
 You´ll have to modify the code to add the exact params of the code.
 
 In a future version that´ll be automated. 
 
 
 Hope you like it, any issue contact me!
